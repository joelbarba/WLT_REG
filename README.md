# Wallet register

This is a very simple Android app to keep your personal expenses under some reasonable control, especially with the cash in your pocket.

It is usual to forget what you spent your money in, especially when you go out (for dinner, travel, having fun, ...).
I know that lived experience has a priceless value, but <strong>have you ever thought (after some fun) how can it be possible that I have spent such amount of money buying things I scarcely remember?<strong/>

<br/><br/>This is how I fixed this lack of memory.
